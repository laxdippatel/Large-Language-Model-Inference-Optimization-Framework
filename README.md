‣ Static batching for improved GPU utilization
‣ Continuous batching for parallel processing
‣ Paged attention for reduced memory footprint
‣ LoRA for low-precision quantization

✨ LLMTools : https://lnkd.in/gNgbBqHz

🔹 Use Case: Training and finetuning LLMs on consumer GPUs
🔹 Features:
‣ Mixed precision training for reduced memory/compute
‣ Data parallelism across multiple GPUs for faster training
‣ Knowledge distillation for efficient student models

🌴 LiteLLM: https://lnkd.in/gy3aHT5m

🔹 Use Case: Unified interface for calling different LLM providers
🔹 Features:
‣ Prompt caching for faster inference
‣ Model fusion for combined LLMs into one optimized model

🚀 Optimum: https://lnkd.in/gQxzcCvw

🔹 Use Case: Defining and building new LLM models from scratch
🔹 Features:
‣ Automatic mixed precision selection per layer
‣ Tensor fusion for combined operations

These frameworks enable deep learning practitioners to unlock the full potential of large language models on GPU hardware through techniques like batching, quantization, parallelism, caching, and operation fusion. Choose the right tool based on your specific LLM use case and optimization goals. 🚀

P.S. Era of GPU Optimization is because of new generation of LLMs is arrived.
